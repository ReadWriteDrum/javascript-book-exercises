What does this code log to the console? Does executing the foo function affect the output? Why or why not?

let bar = 1;
function foo() {
  let bar = 2;
}

foo();
console.log(bar);


This code logs 1 to the console. Executing the foo function does not affect the output because it has a local scope and is different than the first bar variable which has a global scope.
