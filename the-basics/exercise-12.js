// What value does the following expression evaluate to?

'12' < '9'

// The expression evaluates as true because the operands are strings and as strings they are compared character by character. The '1' in '12' is first compared to '9' and since 1 is less than 9 it assumes '12' must be less than '9' and evaluates as true.
